I am not satisfied with LLM generating questions and the output is also not displayed. I am going to tell you exactly what you need to do at each step.

Suppose user selects partial HTS Number from one of the three option:
  - Complete 10-digit HTS Number
  - Partial HTS (4/6 digit) Number
  - Product description

The user after selecting 2nd option, The user will enter partial HTS number, either 4 or 6 digit e.g. (0101 or 0101.21),
Then the next will LLM come to start QA session.
Suppose the user enters 0101, the LLM will perform its embeddings to match the query embeddings with documnet embeddings which was processed csv.
The LLM will fetch 7 candidates because there are 7 HTS Numner that start with 0101. Then LLM as QA session on product specifications levels. Note that the questions should be based only on spec_levels,.For example:
  - Is it a horse? The options should be yes or no. If user selects yes then, the candidates will narrow down to 4 because there are only 4 rows with horses spec level.
  - Is it purebred? The options should be yes or no. If user selects no, the the candidates will narrow down to 2, because among 4 there was 2 with purebred spec level.
  - Besides purebred, there are 2 left with same spec level with "other" in them. So we ask question based on next immediate spec level.
  - Is it imported for immediate slaughter? The options should be yes or no. f the user selects no, then the candidate will narrow down to 1, because there was only 1 horse row with immediate slaughter spec.
  - Now that we have final candidate, the app should automatically display it's details at the end:
    - HTS Number
    - Indent
    - Description
    - Specifications (Spec_Level_1 to so on, in single heading)
    - Unit of Quantity
    - General_Rate_of_Duty
    - Special_Rate_of_Duty
    - Column_2_Rate_of_Duty
  - Now let's say if the user would have selected no option for 1st question, then the next question would be:
    - Is it asses? If the user select no, then the next would be
    - Is it imported for immediate slaughter? because the reamaining would be narrow down to 2 with same Spec_level_1, so the LLM would ask question based on next spec level.
    - If the user again slects no, then there would only be 1 candidate remaining.

So the scenario is, the questions can generate unlimitedly until we have on final candiate after confirminig user's choice or answer based on questions on each Spec_level.
There might as well 10 Spec_levels each spec_level with different values in them in different rows but with same partial HTS number. So the LLM should be able to handle all of it.
